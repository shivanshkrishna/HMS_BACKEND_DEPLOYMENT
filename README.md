# üè• Hospital Management System Backend

Welcome to the backend repository for the Hospital Management System software. In this project, I've developed the backend infrastructure to handle various functionalities crucial for managing a hospital efficiently.

## üîë Key Features

- **JWT Authentication and Authorization**: Implemented robust JWT authentication and authorization to ensure secure access control to the system.
- **Validator for Data Validation**: Utilized a validator for thorough validation of incoming data, ensuring data integrity and security.
- **Dedicated Controllers and Models**: Created dedicated controllers and models for essential components such as Appointments, Users, and Messages, ensuring organized and modular code structure.
- **Tailored Routers**: Developed over 5 tailored routers to optimize data flow and system performance, enhancing scalability and maintainability.
- **Integration of Cloudinary**: Integrated Cloudinary for seamless media management, allowing efficient storage and retrieval of media files.
- **NoSQL Database**: Utilized a NoSQL database for flexible data storage, enabling easy scalability and adaptability to changing requirements.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **Node.js**: Backend runtime environment.
- **Express.js**: Web application framework for Node.js, used for building the backend server.
- **JWT**: JSON Web Tokens for authentication and authorization.
- **Validator**: Library for data validation.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for flexible data storage.

## üöÄ Running the Server

To run the server, make sure you have installed all the depedencies by running: npm install 
Then make sure you have Node.js and `nodemon` installed on your system.

If you haven't installed `nodemon` globally yet, you can do so by running: npm install -g nodemon


Then, navigate to the directory where your `server.js` file is located using the terminal or command prompt, and simply run:


This command will start your Node.js server using `nodemon`, which will automatically restart the server whenever changes are detected in your files, making the development process smoother and more efficient.
